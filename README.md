# Reddit

Work in progress on finding hot trends in Reddit data sets. Here I employ probabilistic Topic Modeling, especially Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The goal is to find the trends over time by using moving average method to compute performance history of each topic within each subreddits and to use BM25 ranking method (state-of-the-art TF-IDF) to develop new trend ranking for the hot Reddit posts.
